# CSE-422-Artificial-intelligence## CSE-422: Artificial Intelligence

This repository contains coursework and projects for the CSE-422 Artificial Intelligence class. It includes lab assignments focusing on foundational AI algorithms and a machine learning project applying AI techniques to a real-world dataset.

**Contents**

- **Lab-01: A* Algorithm**
  - Implementation of the A* search algorithm, a popular pathfinding and graph traversal method in AI.

- **Lab-02: Genetic Algorithm**
  - Demonstrates the use of genetic algorithms for optimization problems, simulating the process of natural selection.

- **Lab-03: Alpha Beta Pruning**
  - Implementation of the Alpha-Beta pruning technique to optimize minimax algorithms, commonly used in game-playing AI.

- **Project: Telecom Churn Prediction using Machine Learning**
  - A machine learning project focused on predicting customer churn in the telecom sector using various algorithms and data analysis techniques.

**Getting Started**
